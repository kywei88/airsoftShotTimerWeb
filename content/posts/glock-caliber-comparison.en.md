## Main Caliber Specifications Comparison

Below is a detailed comparison table of Glock's three main calibers:

|Item|9×19mm (9mm)|.45 ACP|10mm Auto|
|---|--:|--:|--:|
|Bullet Diameter (approx.)|9.01 mm|11.43 mm|10.16 mm|
|Common Case Length (approx.)|19.0 mm|23.0 mm|25.0 mm|
|Typical Bullet Weight (gr)|115–147 gr|185–230 gr|155–200 gr|
|Typical Muzzle Velocity (fps / m/s)|Approx. **1150–1300 fps** (**351–396 m/s**)|Approx. **800–900 fps** (**244–274 m/s**)|Approx. **1200–1400 fps** (**366–427 m/s**)|
|Typical Muzzle Energy (ft·lb / J)|Approx. **340–550 ft·lb** (**460–748 J**)|Approx. **260–414 ft·lb** (**356–561 J**)|Approx. **495–870 ft·lb** (**672–1180 J**)|
|Typical Applications|Defense, law enforcement, competition, civilian|Traditional close-range stopping, defense (large caliber)|High energy, hunting, defense, better penetration/long-range energy|
|Advantages (Summary)|Lower recoil, high capacity, easy ammunition availability, strong versatility|High impact (wider bullet), excellent close-range stopping|High energy, flat trajectory, retains energy at longer distances|
|Disadvantages (Summary)|Penetration/stopping power in some situations depends on well-designed bullets|Capacity and recoil not conducive to rapid fire|Recoil, gun wear, and shooter control difficulty; ammunition cost/availability less than 9mm|
|Common Glock Representative Models (Original/Common)|G17 / G19 / G26 / G34 / G43X / G48|G21 / G30 / G36 / G41|G20 / G29|

## How to Choose the Right Caliber?

- **9mm**: Best suited for beginners and daily training, cheap and readily available ammunition
- **.45 ACP**: Suitable for users seeking large caliber stopping power
- **10mm Auto**: Suitable for situations requiring higher energy, such as hunting or wilderness self-defense

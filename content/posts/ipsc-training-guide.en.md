## What is IPSC?

IPSC (International Practical Shooting Confederation) is a shooting sport that combines **speed, accuracy, and power**. Unlike traditional target shooting, IPSC emphasizes quick and precise shooting in dynamic environments, closely simulating real-world scenarios.

### IPSC Core Principles: DVC

- **D (Diligentia)** - Accuracy: Every shot must hit the target
- **V (Vis)** - Power: Use adequate power ammunition
- **C (Celeritas)** - Speed: Complete shooting in the shortest time

## IPSC Competition Divisions

IPSC is divided into multiple divisions to accommodate shooters of all levels:

### Production Division
- Closest to factory configuration pistols
- Suitable for beginners
- 15-round magazine limit

### Standard Division
- Allows basic modifications
- 15-round magazine limit
- Minimum 9mm caliber

### Open Division
- Most freedom in modifications
- Red dot sights and compensators allowed
- Pursuit of ultimate speed

### Classic Division
- Traditional pistol designs
- Red dot sights not allowed
- For classic firearm enthusiasts

## IPSC Training with AirsoftShotTimer

### 1. Draw Training

The most fundamental and important skill in IPSC.

**Training Steps:**
1. Adopt competition stance (hands naturally relaxed)
2. Upon hearing timer signal, quickly draw
3. Fire 2 shots at target (Double Tap)
4. Record "first shot time"

**Target Times (Airsoft):**
- Beginner: 1.5-2.0 seconds
- Intermediate: 1.0-1.5 seconds
- Advanced: 0.8-1.0 seconds
- Expert: < 0.8 seconds

**Using AirsoftShotTimer:**
- Set "random delay" mode (1-4 seconds)
- Train real reactions, avoid signal prediction
- Record each draw time
- Analyze movement fluidity

### 2. Split Time Training

Split time is the interval between two shots, a key indicator of shooting speed.

**Training Method:**
1. Stand 7 meters from target
2. Draw and fire 5 consecutive shots
3. Analyze intervals between each shot

**Standard Split Times:**
- A-zone hits (close range 7m): 0.20-0.25 seconds
- A-zone hits (mid range 15m): 0.25-0.35 seconds
- Precision shooting (long range 25m): 0.40-0.60 seconds

**AirsoftShotTimer Advantages:**
- Automatically records each shot time
- Calculates average split time
- Tracks progress curve

### 3. Reload Training

Fast magazine changes can save precious seconds in IPSC competition.

**Tactical Reload:**
- Change magazine while rounds remain
- Retain original magazine
- Used during cover or tactical movement

**Speed Reload:**
- Shoot until magazine empty
- Drop empty magazine
- Quickly insert new magazine

**Training Focus:**
1. Smooth movement continuity
2. Don't look down at magazine
3. Keep muzzle pointed at target direction
4. Support hand accurately grabs magazine

**Target Times:**
- Tactical reload: 2.0-2.5 seconds
- Speed reload: 1.5-2.0 seconds
- Expert level: < 1.5 seconds

### 4. Multiple Target Transition Training

IPSC scenarios often have multiple targets; quick transitions are essential.

**Training Setup:**
- Set up 3-5 targets
- 1-3 meters spacing between targets
- 2 shots per target

**Key Techniques:**
- Eyes lead (look at next target first)
- Gun follows eyes (muzzle follows vision)
- Keep upper body stable
- Minimize footwork adjustments

**Using AirsoftShotTimer:**
1. Record total time for all targets
2. Analyze transition speed
3. Identify hesitation points
4. Practice repeatedly until smooth

### 5. Moving Shooting Training

IPSC is not static shooting; stability while moving is crucial.

**Training Scenarios:**
- Side Step shooting
- Moving Forward shooting
- Moving Backward shooting

**Key Points:**
- Keep upper body stable (imagine glass of water on head)
- Knees slightly bent, absorb shock
- Light footwork, avoid bouncing
- Timing shots (instant foot lands)

### 6. PAR Time Training

PAR (Par Time) training is essential for IPSC experts.

**What is PAR Time?**
Set a target time; must complete shooting before time expires. If not achieved, timer sounds alert.

**Training Benefits:**
- Build shooting rhythm
- Overcome competition pressure
- Break through speed plateaus
- Train decision-making speed

**Training Example:**
1. Set PAR Time to 2.0 seconds
2. Draw and fire 2 shots
3. Must complete within 2.0 seconds
4. Gradually shorten PAR Time after achievement

**Using AirsoftShotTimer PAR Mode:**
- Fixed PAR: Train consistency
- Random PAR: Train adaptability
- Progressive PAR: Break personal limits

## Advanced IPSC Training Techniques

### Cover Shooting

**Key Points:**
- Minimize body exposure
- Quick exposure to shoot
- Immediately return to cover after shooting
- Maintain safe muzzle direction

**Training Process:**
1. Stand behind cover
2. Upon signal, expose and fire 2 shots
3. Immediately return to cover
4. Record complete movement time

### Strong/Weak Hand Training

IPSC stage designs may require hand transitions.

**Weak Hand Training:**
- Shoot with non-dominant hand only
- Maintain same accuracy
- Target time: 150% of strong hand

**Hand Transition:**
- Smooth firearm transfer
- Maintain safe muzzle direction
- Don't look down at gun

### Stress Training

Simulate competition pressure scenarios.

**Training Method:**
1. First perform high-intensity physical training (burpees, sprints)
2. Immediately proceed to shooting training
3. Record performance under fatigue
4. Practice focus under pressure

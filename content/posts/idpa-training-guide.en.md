## What is IDPA?

IDPA (International Defensive Pistol Association) is a shooting sport emphasizing **realistic defensive scenarios**. Unlike IPSC, IDPA focuses more on practical application, requiring shooters to use **concealed carry** equipment and shoot in scenarios simulating everyday threats.

### IDPA Core Philosophy

- **Defense First**: Stage designs derived from real defensive situations
- **Concealed Carry**: Must use equipment suitable for daily carry
- **Cover Usage**: Mandatory proper cover utilization
- **Tactical Thinking**: Focus on decision-making and threat assessment

## IDPA vs. IPSC Differences

### Different Design Philosophy

| Aspect | IDPA | IPSC |
|--------|------|------|
| **Goal** | Defensive training | Competition shooting |
| **Scenarios** | Real-life situations | Competitive challenge scenarios |
| **Equipment** | Daily concealed carry | Competition-specific modifications |
| **Cover** | Mandatory proper use | Optional use |
| **Magazines** | Penalty for dropping | Can freely discard |
| **Reloads** | Must be behind cover | Can reload anytime |
| **Speed** | Slower but more tactical | Pursuit of ultimate speed |

## IDPA Training with AirsoftShotTimer

### 1. Concealed Carry Draw Training

IDPA requires drawing from concealed carry status, more challenging than open holsters.

**Training Steps:**
1. Wear clothing covering holster (jacket, shirt)
2. Adopt natural stance (hands naturally relaxed)
3. Upon signal, move clothing aside and draw
4. Fire 2 shots at target

**Target Times (Airsoft):**
- Beginner: 2.5-3.5 seconds
- Intermediate: 2.0-2.5 seconds
- Advanced: 1.5-2.0 seconds
- Expert: < 1.5 seconds

**Using AirsoftShotTimer:**
- Random delay start
- Record concealed draw time
- Compare with open holster
- Practice smooth clothing movement

### 2. Cover Shooting Training

IDPA's most core skill: proper cover usage.

**Cover Rules:**
- **Body exposure < 50%**: No penalty
- **Body exposure > 50%**: Time penalty
- **No cover use**: Severe penalty

**Training Scenario:**
1. Stand behind cover (wall corner, doorframe)
2. Upon signal, expose and shoot
3. Immediately return to cover after shooting
4. Ensure minimal body exposure

**Key Techniques:**
- **Angled Exposure**: 45-degree side angle for minimal exposure
- **High/Low Switch**: Flexible use of high and low stances
- **Eyes Lead**: Vision confirms target first
- **Gun Follows Eyes**: Muzzle follows vision

**Using AirsoftShotTimer:**
1. Set PAR time (e.g., 3 seconds)
2. Must complete cover exposure and shooting within time
3. Train quick decision-making and execution
4. Record and analyze movement fluidity

### 3. Tactical Reload Training

IDPA requires magazine changes behind cover.

**Training Focus:**
1. Shoot until magazine nearly empty (1-2 rounds remaining)
2. Retreat behind cover
3. Change magazine and chamber round
4. Expose and shoot again

**Key Techniques:**
- **Retain Magazine**: Cannot discard (3-second penalty)
- **Pocket Management**: Place in pocket or magazine pouch
- **Smooth Movement**: Reload motion must be proficient
- **Don't Look Down**: Eyes remain observing threats

**Training Process:**
1. Use AirsoftShotTimer to record time
2. Expose from cover and fire 5 rounds
3. Retreat to cover and change magazine
4. Expose and fire 5 more rounds
5. Analyze overall completion time

### 4. Movement to Cover Training

IDPA emphasizes safe movement to cover positions.

**Training Scenario:**
1. Starting position has no cover
2. Cover 5-10 meters ahead
3. Upon signal, quickly move to cover
4. Shoot target upon reaching cover

**Key Points:**
- **Low Posture Movement**: Lower body center of gravity
- **Muzzle Safety**: Maintain safe direction
- **Visual Awareness**: Observe threat direction
- **Immediate Engagement**: Shoot immediately upon reaching cover

**Using AirsoftShotTimer:**
- Record movement plus shooting total time
- Analyze balance between movement speed and shooting accuracy
- Find optimal movement routes

### 5. Multiple Threat Assessment Training

IDPA scenarios often have "shoot" and "no-shoot" targets.

**Training Objectives:**
- Quickly identify threats vs. non-threats
- Correctly decide shooting priority
- Avoid shooting innocent targets

**Training Setup:**
1. Set up 3-5 targets
2. 1-2 are "non-threats" (hostages, bystanders)
3. Must only shoot threat targets
4. Shooting non-threat targets incurs severe penalty

**Key Points:**
- **Confirm Target**: Must verify before shooting
- **Threat Priority**: Shoot nearest or most dangerous target first
- **Control Shooting**: Avoid excessive shooting

### 6. One-Handed Shooting Training

IDPA may require one-handed shooting (simulating injury or supporting others).

**Strong Hand Shooting:**
- Use dominant hand to shoot
- Other hand can support others or open doors
- Maintain shooting stability

**Weak Hand Shooting:**
- Use non-dominant hand to shoot
- Simulates strong hand injury scenario
- Higher challenge

**Training Method:**
1. Use AirsoftShotTimer to record time
2. Strong hand single-hand shoot 5 rounds
3. Weak hand single-hand shoot 5 rounds
4. Compare hand differences
5. Strengthen weak hand training

## Advanced IDPA Tactical Techniques

### Slicing the Pie

**Technique Steps:**
1. Stand at cover edge
2. Side-step in small increments
3. Gradually expand vision
4. Shoot immediately upon finding target
5. Return to cover after shooting

**Training Focus:**
- Small steps (5-10 cm)
- Keep muzzle pointed at observation area

### Low Posture Shooting

Shooting from behind low cover, reducing risk of being hit.

**Key Points:**
